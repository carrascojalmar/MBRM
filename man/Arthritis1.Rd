\description{
This dataset contains binary response data from a longitudinal study on rheumatoid arthritis.
The data include repeated measurements on 38 individuals, each with 5 time points.
}
\details{
The original data was collected to evaluate the effect of a treatment over time on arthritis severity.
Covariates include demographic and clinical variables, and the response is binary (presence/absence of symptoms).
