\description{
This dataset contains binary response data from a longitudinal study on rheumatoid arthritis.
The data includes repeated measurements on 38 individuals, each with 5 time points.
}
\details{

Covariates include demographic and clinical variables, and the response is binary (presence/absence of symptom).
